# Stock Notifier

If you like to stay updated on your favourite stock investments, this 
application keeps track of all your stocks and regularly checks for updates to
the stock prices. You can also configure the percentage change in stock value 
when you would like to receive alerts. The alerts are raised as desktop 
notifications.
